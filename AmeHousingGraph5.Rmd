### My Favorite Graph

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# This tutorial will use the following two packages
library(ggplot2)
library(mosaic)
```

In this tutorial, we will use the  [AmesHousing](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf) data, which provides information on the sales of individual residential properties in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. The data set contains 2930 observations, and a large number of explanatory variables involved in assessing home values. A full description of this dataset can be found [here](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/Decock/DataDocumentation.txt).

```{r}
# The csv file should be imported into rstudio:
AmesHousing <- read.csv("data/AmesHousing.csv")
# str(AmesHousing)
```


Here is my favorite graph of the Ames Housing data.

```{r}
ggplot(data=AmesHousing) +                         
      geom_histogram(mapping = aes(SalePrice/100000), 
          breaks=seq(0, 7, by = 1), col="red", fill="lightblue") + 
      geom_density(mapping = aes(x=SalePrice/100000, y = (..count..)))  +   
      labs(title="Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa (in $100,000)", 
          x="Sale Price of Individual Homes")   
```

**Remarks:**
Provide a short description of your work here.

Histogram of Sales Price of Individual Homes (in the 100,000s) in Ames, IA. The distribution is right skewed and the majority of homes are priced between 100,000 and 200,000.
